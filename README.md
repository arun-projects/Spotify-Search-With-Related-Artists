# Spotify Song Search with Related Artists

- In this lab we will be working to create a song search application with two pages.
- Your job is to use the Spotify API to allow users to search for songs, and return related artists when a song is clicked on.
- The API endpoint for searching for songs can be found [here](https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/search-item/).
- The API endpoint for getting related artists can be found [here](https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/get-related-artists/).
